# Train It Log It

This project uses JavaScript and Firebase to create a web app that allows users to be able to sign up/sign in and record their workouts. Users are only able to enter the app once they have either signed up or logged into their existing account. It also includes a leaderboard among the various workout options so that users are able to see where they stand amongst other users. Users are also able to add/remove friends and also see a leaderboard that is tailored to just their friends.
